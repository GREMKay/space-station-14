  # Core Rule 4 - yes sexual content/themes, including erotic roleplay (ERP) and shock content
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Erotic Roleplay (commonly abbreviated as "ERP") and sexual content is allowed. This includes direct and indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. Slight leeway is given to insults, but this rule is otherwise strictly enforced.

  In-game romantic relationships should not become the focus of the game for you and anyone else involved.

  Things that appear to be intended to or are likely to disturb players out of character are considered shock content and are not allowed.

  ## Examples
  Allowed:
  - Telling someone that they are being a dickhead.
  - Telling someone that you are going to kill the captain, as long as it is clear that you mean it in character.
